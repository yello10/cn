Lab 10 – NS2 simulator – Network Analysis
Create a network with a series of ‘n’ nodes connected one after another like a string. The nodes
are spaced 150m apart from each other. The data communication between any two nodes is
possible only by transfer of data between neighboring nodes and a single TCP connection is
established between the source and the destination nodes for transfer of all packets in a specific
communication. Each node has a buffer/queue which can hold a maximum of 50 packets and can
aid in transmission of packets in first-in-first-out fashion. Simulate the following for 60 seconds:
1. communication by the first node to the last node, considering that the first node generates
data at a rate of 4 packets/second with each packet having 1460 bytes for the following
window sizes: 4, 8 and 32.
2. communication by a node to its neighboring node, considering that the former node
generates data at a rate of 4 packets/second with each packet having 1460 bytes for the
following window sizes: 4, 8 and 32.
3. keeping the window size as 8, simultaneous communications by the first node to ith node
and jth node to the last node (if there are n nodes from 0 through n-1, 0 < i < j < n - 1).
4. keeping the window size as 8, simulate two communications, the first from node i to j and
the second from node k to j - 1 (0 < k < j – 1 < i < n) in the following two scenarios:
a. both communications start at the same time.
b. the second communication start 10 seconds after the first.
